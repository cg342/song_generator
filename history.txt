I am a New Creation, Great in power, Create in me a Clean Heart, House of the Lord
How Majestic is Your Name, How Great is Your Love, Christ in me (is to live to die is to gain)
He has made me glad, Here is Love (vast as the ocean)
Precious cornerstone, Forever Grateful
My life is in you lord, I wanna sing, Amazing love (you are my king), Give Thanks
How high and how wide, How precious Oh Lord, I Offer My Life
